# clipboard2markdown

> Convert rich text or HTML from the clipboard into Markdown or clean HTML quickly.

## What this fork is

**clipboard2markdown** (this repo) is a fork of
[euangoddard/clipboard2markdown](https://github.com/euangoddard/clipboard2markdown).
Most of the original idea and UI remain, but this fork includes multiple
improvements and feature additions to make conversion more flexible and
safer for modern workflows.

Key differences:

- New **Clean HTML** output mode (sanitized HTML output in addition to Markdown)
- Option to **Convert headings to bold** (useful when pasting into rich web forms that fail to properly handle `#` headings during PDF-conversion)
- Options: `drop images`, `drop bold`, `dash → hyphen`, `De-PDF` cleanup, `pandoc` headings
- Rendering of Clean HTML directly in the Output pane with a **Clear** action
- Improved sanitization and attribute stripping when producing HTML
- Unit tests with **Vitest** and a cleaner dev setup (Vite, TypeScript)

## Usage notes

- Paste from any app (web page, Word, PDF viewers) and the app will attempt to
  detect HTML, plain text, or typical PDF artifacts and apply a sensible
  conversion.
- Toggle **Clean HTML** in the _Options_ to return minimal, sanitized HTML
  instead of Markdown (useful for pasting into rich text form fields).
- Use **Convert headings to bold** when heading markers (`#`) cause issues in
  target web forms; the converter will turn headings into bold paragraphs.
- `De-PDF` mode attempts to undo soft hyphenation and broken line wraps common
  to PDF-to-text copy/paste.

## Code & implementation notes

- HTML → Markdown is handled by **turndown** (with a few custom rules).
- Clean HTML output is generated by rendering the Markdown back to HTML
  (using **marked**) and then stripping presentation attributes like
  `style`, `class`, `id`, and `data-*` attributes.
- The converter is conservative with headings: when the source contains
  heading tags we try to preserve the original heading text and spacing.

## Icons & PWA

Favicon and PWA manifest entries are under `public/` and `index.html` is
preconfigured to surface the appropriate icons for Apple, Android and desktop
browsers. Replace files in `public/` to change the app icons.
